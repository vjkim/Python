### Intro to classes


# Object-orientated program is the best way to write applications.
# In object oriented classes, they represent real world things.
# When you write a class, you are defining a whole category of things an object can have. 
# Then, when you generate an individual thing, from the class, each thing is given the same parameters as the class.

# Instances ==> Classes
